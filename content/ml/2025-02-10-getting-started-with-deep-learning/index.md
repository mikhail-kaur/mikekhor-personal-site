# Getting Started with Deep Learning

Deep learning has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence. In this post, we'll explore the fundamentals and get you started with your first neural network.

## What is Deep Learning?

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to learn from data.

A typical neural network consists of:
- Input layer
- Hidden layers
- Output layer

## Key Concepts

1. **Neurons**: The basic computational unit
2. **Layers**: Groups of neurons that process information
3. **Weights**: Parameters that are learned during training

## Your First Neural Network

Here's a simple example using Python and TensorFlow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```
